- 👋 Hi, This is the official Lunna Github Repository
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything on how to build a sustainable social media platform using open source tools and sharing the knowledge from that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching developers to make use of the lunna eco-system.
- 📫 shoot us an email at developers@lunna.chat
